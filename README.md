## 🚀 About me
I'm a full stack developer and web designer with a passion for creating visually appealing and functional websites. I also specialize in robotic automations(RPA), which allows me to bring an extra layer of automation and efficiency to my projects.

With a total of +30 repos, my GitHub profile is a showcase of my work and my dedication to always be learning and pushing my skills to the next level.

I am experienced in using ReactJS as my go-to JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Python and R lang for data driven apps and machine learning. I also enjoy working with TailwindCSS and BootStrap 4,5, a utility-first CSS framework that allows me to create fast loading and highly customizable designs.

Take a look around my profile and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you're interested in working together on a project.

Thanks for visiting!
